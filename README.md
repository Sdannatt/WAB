# WAB
 The start of a small Warhammer 40K army builder project
 
 

Why am I doing this?

I am doing this as a test of my knowledge learned during my QAC tech skills Bootcamp, to gauge my understanding of the different parts of 
building an API such as using Jira to plan, using version control on github, MySQL, Java, Springboot and Maven.



How did I expect the challenge to go?

Initially I thought it wouldnt be too much of a problem, but I ended up facing a number of issues that slowed me down quite considerably and 
put me in a position where I was unable to fully complete the project. For example, my computer did an automatic update halfway through project hand in week and I lost quite alot of work as a result.
This then pushed back many alot of features resulting in an incomplete project, as well as preventing me from having the time to add my own custom functionality.
However I did learn the importance of making sure you are regularly creating commits throughout your work so that nothing is lost.



Possible Improvements for future revisions of the project

Honestly, just to make sure that work is backed up and that I have fully considered the time it will take to complete. My github commit history could be neater as well,
so for future reference I need to practice some of the basic Java functionality so that I am not slowed down by incorrect code, and to make sure I fully understand the process (and commands used)
for correctly committing to a github repository

# Postman Screenshots

Unfortunately I was unable to carry out my Postman requests. My postman was unable to connect at any point in time
and when trying to look into it, the solution suggested was that the port numbers were not accurate, however when I checked the port numbers were matching. I could not for the life of me fix this problem.

# Database Screenshots

I also couldn't get screenshots showing that my data persisted.

# Testing Screenshots

Due to the technical error mentioned previously, I did not have the time to re-construct my program and implement testing, so I don't have screen shots of those either.

(I know, i'm sorry, I feel like I have let both you Chris, and you Richard, down, apologies.)

# Jira 

Here is the link to my Jira though, I do have that!
